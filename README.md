## Concept

Date shown at the Bottom of the screen ---- Animated ski doo in front of the person. To achieve a driving look, the Snowmobile is vibrating and accompanied by a loud engine sound --- To further visualize speed, the snowflakes are flying with a high velocity away from the camera --- By Tapping the screen the Engine starts and the drive begins --- At the top of the screen is a little Introduction "Tap to Start" which gets invisible as soon the screen gets tapped.
